            After analyzing the district-wide standardized test results, and taking into consideration every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend, we have recognized some trends in the  performance. The first trend that I explored was the effect that the school’s budget had on the student. I quickly realized that as the spending ranges per student increased, the overall passing scores decreased. Therefore, concluding that the school’s budget does not necessarily improve the scores. 

    When looking at the data, we could tell that for the most part, both district and charter schools had similar budgets. On the other hand, charter schools had a much better overall passing percentage, and after exploring the total students and the school’s size, the scores made sense.
    It turns out that the smaller, and medium schools had significantly better scores. It is also interesting to note that the math scores were affected, more than the reading scores by the size. To conclude, the main priority after the analysis would be  to work on balancing the school’s size or the amount of students per teacher
